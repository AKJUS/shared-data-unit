# The BBC Shared Data Unit: Who are we

An innovative team of journalists investigating datasets to tell stories of public interest that matter to local audiences.  We passionately believe that in a world where the amount of digital information has increased exponentially, public bodies will only be held to account if journalists have the tech skills and time to interrogate these sources.  We will work with partners in the local media industry to widen the reporting of public data across the UK.

We believe in making our journalism accessible to as many people as possible.  We believe data journalism opens up the potential for new storytelling techniques.

# What we do 

* Monitor and interrogate officially published datasets to investigate issues of public interest
* Use Freedom of Information laws to gather data not publically available
* Extract structured content from web pages
* Analyse datasets for local angles we can share with media partners
* Present our findings in easy-to-understand guides 
* Work alongside secondees from the industry to help them bring ideas from conception to journalism that can be used on BBC platforms
* Foster and develop a network of trained data journalists 
* Encourage best practice in working with and reporting on data, and increase the capability of data journalism at a local level.
* Make packaged content for BBC English Regions audiences 
* We will be open and transparent with our methodologies, and encourage a conversation between our network of reporters.
